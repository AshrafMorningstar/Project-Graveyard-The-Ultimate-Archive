        After remaining closed since March this year due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, churches in Mumbai will resume Mass from Sunday with strict adherence to all the government regulations and necessary protocols in place. The state government had permitted reopening of religious places on November 16. However, churches remained closed and only private prayers were allowed so far. Face masks and social distancing norms have been made compulsory. Adults above the age of 65 years, children below 10, and persons with fever, cold, cough, and comorbidities will not be allowed inside church premises. Churches will continue to organise online masses for people who cannot step out as of now, according to Archbishop of Bombay.
