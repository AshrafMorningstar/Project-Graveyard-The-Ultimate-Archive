## 🚀 Revolutionary Platform

**TITAN REALITY WEAVER** is a massively distributed, differentiable digital-twin platform that models, simulates, and optimizes real-world systems in real time. It fuses live sensor streams, physics-informed neural simulators, causal models and control agents into a single composable fabric.

### 🎯 Key Capabilities

- **Differentiable Simulators** — End-to-end differentiable physics + learned components
- **Hybrid Multi-Scale Modeling** — Combine high-fidelity physics, ML surrogates, and discrete events
- **Live Data Fusion** — Ingest streams from IoT, PLCs, edge cameras, telemetry
- **Causal Engine & Counterfactuals** — Run what-if experiments with causal guarantees
- **Closed-Loop Control Deployment** — Synthesize safe control policies (MPC + learned controllers)
- **Federated & Private Learning** — Train across edge nodes without exposing raw data
- **Verifiable Provenance & Auditability** — Cryptographically signed model checkpoints
- **High-Performance Distributed Runtime** — Cloud GPUs, edge compute, and browser visualization
