# Zenith Forge — Expert-Level Procedural Synthesis & Render Farm (Prototype)

**Zenith Forge** is an intentionally massive, research-grade project blueprint for **procedural visual synthesis**, **distributed rendering**, and **AI-assisted visual design**.

It combines:

- **Remotion** for video composition.
- **WebGL/GLSL** for high-performance visual effects.
- **Distributed Worker Plane** for scaling rendering across multiple nodes.
- **Unified Plugin System** for extensible visual modules.

## Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for a deep dive into the system design.

## Features (Prototype)

- **Control Plane**: Node.js based orchestrator (`server/index.js`).
- **Worker Plane**: Prototype rendering worker (`workers/worker-prototype.js`).
- **Visual Synthesis**: GLSL shader integration (`shaders/complex.glsl`).
- **Plugin API**: extensible architecture for new visual modules.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Start Control Plane**: `npm start`
3. **Start Worker**: `npm run worker`
4. **Build composition**: `npm run build`

## Disclaimer

This is a comprehensive blueprint/scaffold. Full distributed operation requires a Kubernetes cluster or similar container orchestration system.
