## 🌌 The Ultimate GitHub Visualization System

**AETHER-VIZ** is a visualization platform so advanced, so elegant, and so professional that it redefines what's possible with GitHub analytics. This is not just another stats generator - it's a masterpiece of design engineering.

### ✨ Visual Features

- **Glass Data Effect**: Frosted glass cards with depth-aware blur.
- **Animated Sculpture System**: Marble & Granite textures for data containers.
- **Holographic Interface**: Depth layering with 12 distinct visual planes.

### 🚀 Usage

This system is designed to run automatically via GitHub Actions, but you can also run it locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Preview the animation
npm start

# Render the Masterpiece GIF
npm run build:gif
```

### 🎨 Configuration

You can customize the visualization by editing `aether-config.json` or modifying the source code in `src/`.

### 🛠️ Architecture

- **DataAlchemist**: Transforms raw GitHub data into visual metrics.
- **VisualSynthesizer**: Creates the 3D scene using React Three Fiber.
- **PerfectionPolisher**: Ensures the output is museum-grade quality.
