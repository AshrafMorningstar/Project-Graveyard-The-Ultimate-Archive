# Ambient Landing

**A Website That Breathes**

> A self-animated, ambient web experience that feels alive without demanding attention. No calls-to-action, no distractions—just calm, continuous presence.

---

## 🎯 Concept Philosophy

Ambient Landing addresses a subtler challenge than most websites: **creating presence without distraction**. The interface exists in a state of calm motion, similar to breathing.

### Core Question

_"How do you create presence without distraction?"_

---

## 🌊 Ambient Motion System

### Motion Characteristics

| Property           | Value                   | Rationale                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Duration**       | 12–20 seconds per cycle | Slow enough to be subconscious |
| **Easing**         | ease-in-out only        | Natural, organic feel          |
| **Scale Changes**  | Under 3%                | Perceptible but not obvious    |
| **Opacity Shifts** | 0.95–1.0                | Subtle breathing effect        |

### Animated Elements

#### Background Orbs (3 total)

- **Orb 1**: Large, white-tinted, top-left
- **Orb 2**: Largest, blue-tinted, bottom-right
- **Orb 3**: Medium, purple-tinted, center

Each orb:

- Moves in slow, organic patterns
- Never moves more than 40px
- Has unique animation timing
- Uses blur for soft edges

#### Typography

- **Headline**: Subtle opacity micro-shift (12s cycle)
- **No jarring animations**
- **Text remains readable** at all times

#### Background Gradient

- Slow gradient direction shift (15s cycle)
- Colors remain harmonious
- No harsh transitions

### Architecture Principles

✅ CSS-first animation  
✅ No timers or JavaScript  
✅ GPU-accelerated transforms only  
✅ Battery-friendly animations

### File Structure

```
ambient-landing/
├── index.html              # Minimal content

## 🚀 Running the Project

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser
2. **Observe** the subtle motion
3. **Wait 20+ seconds** to see full animation cycles
4. No interaction required
