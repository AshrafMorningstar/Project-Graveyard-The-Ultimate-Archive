# Implementation Plan - Multi-Language Code Generator Bot

## Goal
Create a Python bot capable of generating code files for 199+ programming languages. Each file will contain >99 lines of meaningful code (implementing standard algorithms like Fibonacci, Factorial, Sorting, etc.) without user intervention.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Scale & Content**: Generating *unique* meaningful code for 199+ languages is complex. I will use a **template-based approach** where a standard "Math/Utility" class is generated for each language, adapted to its specific syntax (comments, blocks, variable declarations). This ensures the "meaningful" and "line count" requirements are met efficiently.

## Proposed Changes

### Core System
#### [NEW] [main.py](file:///c:/Users/Admin/.gemini/antigravity/playground/final-celestial/main.py)
- The main entry point.
- Loads language definitions.
- Iterates through languages and generates files.
- Handles directory creation.

#### [NEW] [language_db.py](file:///c:/Users/Admin/.gemini/antigravity/playground/final-celestial/language_db.py)
- A large dictionary/database containing syntax rules for 199+ languages.
- Properties per language: `name`, `extension`, `comment_single`, `block_start`, `block_end`, `var_decl`, `print_stmt`, `function_def`, etc.

#### [NEW] [generator.py](file:///c:/Users/Admin/.gemini/antigravity/playground/final-celestial/generator.py)
- Contains the logic to assemble the "MathUtility" program using the syntax rules.
- Algorithms to implement:
    1.  Fibonacci (Recursive)
    2.  Fibonacci (Iterative)
    3.  Factorial
    4.  IsPrime
    5.  BubbleSort
    6.  ReverseString
    7.  PalindromeCheck
    8.  CountWords
- Ensures the output exceeds 99 lines by adding docstrings and verbose logic.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Run `python main.py`.
- Verify that a `output` directory is created.
- Verify that files for multiple languages exist.
- Randomly check a few files to ensure they have >99 lines.
