# Persona Tiles 🎭

> Build your digital persona using interactive, modular tiles representing skills, interests, values, and goals

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-complete-success)
![Skill Level](https://img.shields.io/badge/level-beginner-blue)

## 🎯 Concept

Persona Tiles reimagines identity construction as a **modular, visual system**. Instead of filling out forms, users compose their persona by selecting and arranging tiles—each representing a trait, skill, interest, or aspiration.

## ✨ Features

- **4 Tile Categories**: Skills, Interests, Values, Goals
- **Dynamic Layout**: Active tiles reorganize automatically
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Selection order determines prominence
- **Smooth Animations**: Satisfying click feedback
- **Keyboard Support**: Full accessibility

## 🎨 Design System

**Colors by Type:**
- Skills: Blue (#3498db)
- Interests: Red (#e74c3c)
- Values: Green (#2ecc71)
- Goals: Orange (#f39c12)

## 🚀 Usage

Click tiles to activate/deactivate them. Active tiles grow and move toward prominence.
