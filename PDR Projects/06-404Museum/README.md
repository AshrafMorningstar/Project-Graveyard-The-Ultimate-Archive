# 404 Museum 🏛️

> A curated exhibition of error states—where failure becomes art

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-complete-success)
![Skill Level](https://img.shields.io/badge/level-beginner-blue)

## 🎯 Concept

404 Museum treats error pages as **designed experiences** rather than afterthoughts. Each error state is a gallery room with its own mood, layout, and emotional message.

## 🏛️ Rooms

1. **404 - Lost**: Curiosity, wandering
2. **403 - Restricted**: Boundaries, exclusion
3. **500 - System Fatigue**: Exhaustion, glitches
4. **Offline - Isolation**: Disconnection, waiting

## ✨ Features

- Museum-style navigation
- Unique emotional tone per room
- Smooth transitions
- Keyboard navigation (Arrow keys)
- Thoughtful error messaging
