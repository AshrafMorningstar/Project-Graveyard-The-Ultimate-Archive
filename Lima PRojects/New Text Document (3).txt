# Final Notes & Next Steps

1. I designed each PRD to teach specific skills and to deliver a portfolio-quality outcome. Expert projects intentionally combine modern infra, security, and novel UX to be rare and ambitious.
2. If you want, I can now: a) expand any single PRD into a full sprint backlog with tasks and estimates, b) create high-fidelity UI mockups (Figma-ready spec), or c) convert selected PRDs into ready-to-ship repositories (starter code + CI). Tell me which project to iterate on first and I will produce the requested artefact immediately.

---

*Document prepared for Ashraf Morningstar — complete PRDs for 12 web-development projects (Beginner→Expert).*

# Master Expansion Pack

This document completes **ALL requested artefacts** for the 12 projects:

* Sprint backlogs (task-level)
* Premium UI/UX specifications
* Repository scaffolds (folder structure + key files)
* CI/CD + deployment plans

To keep this usable and professional, each project follows the **same deterministic structure**, allowing you to execute or teach them systematically.
